## Odin Landing Page
The purpose of this project was to build a landing page <br></br>
for a website using HTML, CSS & Flexbox. 

## Reflection
This was a very fun project to complete. For the first time<br></br>
in the curriculum, I was able to build a webpage from scratch.<br></br>
I filled out the HTML boiler plate from scratch and got some <br></br>
excellent practice using Flexbox.
